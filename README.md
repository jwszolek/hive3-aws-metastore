## Hive3 AWS Metastore

### Intro
Running Hive locally can present challenges, particularly when dealing with differing library versions and absent JAR files. In my research, I grappled with setting up a local Hive instance that stores data in a specific S3 bucket on AWS. My primary objective was to establish a functional environment for experimentation.

*Note: Docker-compose-based setups are not intended for production environments. They should be managed on Kubernetes. This setup was created solely for testing purposes.*
